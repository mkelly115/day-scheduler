# day-scheduler

The purpose of this project was to allow a user to save important notes corresponding to hours in a 9 to 5 workday. The user will be able to see the current date on the top of the page, and the app alters CSS colors to make important tasks more easily identifiable.

## Usage

When the user has clicked the save button, the text area will be saved to local storage for further use. Under the hood, using JS, Jquery, and Day.JS, the user is able to have their hours color coded based on the current time. Current time will show as red, past will show gray, and future will come in as green. The top of the scheduler will also feature the current date. All of the users input is stored locally and can be called to the page as long as the user does not clear it. The user can delete and click save to empty out an hours text slot.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I've found that with this project, some things are starting to "click" more and become easier to decipher as needed. I feel much more confident using online resources such as MDN, documents for jquery, days.JS, and W3 schools. The save button came fairly intuitively to me after our past classes, but the process of figuring out how to identify the ID of each text area and comparing it to the current time took alot of research and workshopping to make work. Eventually I found it easier to actually identify the class of todo within each, in conjuction with renaming the ID's to just numbers to make it easier to compare the time to a simple number. I'm still not 100% on the concepts behind it and will be taking extra time and care to understand not just that the code works but WHY it works.
